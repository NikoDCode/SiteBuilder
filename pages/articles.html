        <h2><a href="articles/articles1.html" class="container_articles_a">BMW 5 Series (E34)</a></h2>

        <div class="container_articles_p">
          <p>The BMW E34 is the third generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was produced from 2 November 1987, until
            1996.
            Initially launched as a saloon in January 1988, the E34 also saw a "Touring" station wagon (estate) body
            style
            added in September 1992, a first for the 5 Series. BMW replaced the E34 with the E39 5 Series in December
            1995,
            although E34 Touring models remained in production until June 1996.
          </p>
          <p>The E34 generation marked the first time all-wheel drive was incorporated into the 5 Series with the
            525iX,
            and
            the first V8 engine to be used in a 5 Series. The E34 also saw the introduction of stability control
            (ASC),
            traction control (ASC+T), a 6-speed manual transmission and adjustable damping (EDC) to the 5 Series
            range.
          </p>
          <p>There was an unusually large range of engines fitted over its lifetime as nine different engine families
            were
            used. These consisted of straight-four, straight-six and V8 engines.</p>
          <p>The E34 M5 is powered by the S38 straight-six engine and was produced in saloon and wagon body styles.<a

        <div class="container_articles_p">
          <p>The BMW E28 is the second generation of BMW 5 Series executive cars, which was produced from 1981 to 1988
            and replaced the E12 5 Series. Pre-series production began in April 1981 and the car was introduced in the
            autumn that year.
          </p>
          <p>The E28 was initially produced with straight-four and straight-six petrol engines until 1983, when the
            524td
            model became the first BMW car to be powered by a diesel engine. It was also the first 5 Series with the
            centre console angled towards the driver and to be available with anti-lock brakes (ABS).</p>

          <p>The first BMW M5 was produced during the E28 generation. It was powered by the M88/3 and S38 straight-six
            engines. The E24 6 Series coup√©s were built on the E28 platform from 1982 to 1989.</p>
          <p>The E28 was replaced by the E34 5 Series in 1988. <a href="articles/articles2.html"

        <h2><a href="articles/articles3.html" class="container_articles_a">BMW 5 Series (E39)</a></h2>
        <div class="container_articles_p">
          <p>The BMW E39 is the fourth generation of the BMW 5 Series range of executive cars, which was manufactured
            from
            1995 to 2004. It was launched in the saloon body style, with the station wagon body style (marketed as
            "Touring") introduced in 1996. The E39 was replaced by the E60 5 Series in 2003, however E39 Touring
            models
            remained in production until May 2004.</p>
          <p>The proportion of chassis components using aluminium significantly increased for the E39, and it was the
            first 5 Series to use aluminium for all major components in the front suspension or any in the rear. It
            was
            also the first 5 Series where a four-cylinder diesel engine was available. Rack and pinion steering was
            used
            for four- and six-cylinder models, the first time that a 5 Series has used this steering system in
            significant
            volumes. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive.</p>
          <p>The high performance E39 M5 saloon was introduced in 1998, powered by a 4.9 L (302 cu in) DOHC V8 engine.
            It
            was the first M5 model to be powered by a V8 engine. <a href="articles/articles3.html"
