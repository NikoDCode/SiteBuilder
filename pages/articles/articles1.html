        <h2>Petrol-engined</h2>
        <p>The base model, available only in Europe, was the petrol-powered four-cylinder 518i. Only available with a
          5-speed manual transmission, a total of 53,248 cars were produced.</p>
        <p>The next petrol model up was the six-cylinder 520i, which began production in January 1988. It was initially
          powered by the BMW M20 single overhead camshaft engine, which was replaced by the BMW M50 double overhead
          camshaft
          engine in 1990. The 520i was the second most popular E34 model globally, with 426,971 units produced. The 525i
          was the most popular E34 model globally with 434,549 units produced. As per the 520i, the 525i initially used
          the M20 engine, which was replaced by the M50 engine in 1990.</p>
        <p>
          Engine volume and year of manufacture often influenced the type of wiring. This was of great importance for
          decoding the configuration and the possibility of further retrofitting. Thus, cars can be divided into two
          types:
          high and low. Wiring had a big influence to the amount of possible options and functions of a car. There also
          was
          update after M50 and M60 introduce.</p>
        <p>A rare E34 model is the petrol-powered six-cylinder 525iX, of which only 9,366 cars were produced. The 525iX
          was the first all-wheel drive 5 Series, and the only all-wheel drive model in the E34 range. It was powered by
          the
          BMW M50 engine and was the first 5 Series to use a rack and pinion steering system.</p>
        <p>There are two versions of the E34 530i: an inline-six model produced from 1988 to 1990, and a V8 model
          produced
          from 1993 to 1995. The earlier model was one of the last applications of the BMW M30 inline-six engine. The V8
          version, which replaced the six-cylinder 535i in the lineup, was powered by the new BMW M60 V8 engine and was
          available with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. Initially, the V8 models were
          differentiated from other models by the wide grill; in 1994 the wide grill became available on other models.
          Between the two versions of the 530i, a total of 57,570 cars were produced.</p>
        <p>The highest six-cylinder model (except for the M5) was the 535i. Despite the '535i' model designation and
          '3.5'
          casting on the intake manifold, the BMW M30 engine found in the E34 535i actually has a displacement of 3.4
          litres
          (207 cu in). There was also a 535i Sport model with M-technic body kit, boot spoiler with brake light, sport
          seats, M-Tech sports leather steering wheel (M-tech 1 for 1988-1989 cars, M-tech 2 for 1990â€“1992), M-technic
          suspension (M-tech springs, stiffer shocks, M-tech 25mm front stabilizer bar, M-tech 18mm rear stabilizer
          bar),
          a
          polished rocker cover and also a limited-slip differential (25% lock) as standard. A total of 97,679 cars were
          produced, including the Alpina B10 (BiTurbo, 3.5) models. The 535i was replaced by the V8-engined 530i and
          540i models in 1993.</p>
        <p>In 1993, the 540i model was added to the top of the 5 Series lineup, powered by the BMW M60 V8 engine and
          available in both Saloon and wagon body styles (the latter not in US). Transmission options were a 6-speed
          manual
          or a 5-speed automatic. A total of 26,485 units were produced. Initially, the V8 models were differentiated
          from other models by the wider grilles. In 1994 the wide grilles became available on other models as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Diesel-engined</h2>

        <p>The first diesel model was the 524td, which was introduced in 1988. This model was replaced by the 525tds in
          1991, and a lower-specification 525td was introduced in 1993. Only the 525tds model was fitted with an
          intercooler.</p>
        <h2>North America</h2>
        <p>In the United States, the E34 model range was launched in October 1988 with the 525i and 535i 6-cylinder
          models
          (for the 1989 model year). Over the course of the E34 generation, the 525i Touring, 530i, 530i Touring, 540i
          and M5 models were sold in the United States. The 3.6 L (220 cu in) version of the M5 remained in production
          until
          1993,by which time the 3.8 L (232 cu in) version was being produced for other countries.</p>
        <h2>M5 model</h2>
        <p>Introduced in September 1988 and produced until August 1995, the E34 M5 was produced in both saloon and
          station wagon ('Touring') body styles, the latter being the first M5 to be available as a wagon.</p>
        <p>The E34 M5 is powered by the BMW S38 inline-six engine, originally with a displacement of 3.6 L (220 cu in)
          and
          an output of 232 kW (311 hp), later upgraded to a 3.8 L (232 cu in) engine rated at 250 kW (335 hp). This 3.8
          litre version of the M5 was first seen by the public at the 1991 Frankfurt Motor Show, where the E34 M5
          Touring
          also saw its debut.</p>
        <p>In its last year of production for the M5, the transmission was upgraded from a 5-speed manual to the Getrag
          420G
          6-speed manual (which was also used by the 540i model).</p>
