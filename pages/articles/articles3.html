        <h1>BMW 5 Series (E39)</h1>
        <h2>Development and launch</h2>

        <p>Development for the E34's successor began in 1993,[citation needed] and ended in 1995. The final design by
          Joji
          Nagashima was selected in June 1992 and later frozen for production under new design chief Chris Bangle.
          With design selection in 1992, the series development phase began and took 39 months until start of
          production.
          The domestic German design patent was filed on 20 April 1994, with an E39 prototype.</p>
        <p>Pre-production cars rolled off the pilot line from February 1995 starting with 523i and 528i models. This was
          followed by the 520i in March 1995, 525td/tds and 540i in April 1995 and 535i in October 1995. In May 1995 BMW
          published the first official photos of the E39. The E39 premiered in September 1995 at the Frankfurt Motor
          Show. Dealer demonstrator cars became available from September 1995 in continental Europe, commencing full
          scale production. In December 1995 sales of saloon models began on the European mainland. Production of
          wagon/estate models began in November 1996.</p>
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <p>The E39 was one of the first vehicles (alongside the E38 7 Series) to have curtain airbags, which protect the
          occupants' heads in a side impact. Standard equipment on the launch models included dual front and side
          airbags, pretensioners and load limiters for the front seatbelts, anti-lock brakes, traction control, power
          steering, and air conditioning. Satellite navigation was also available, initially using maps on CD-ROMs,
          then moving to DVD maps in 2002. Several models were available in Sports or Executive trim levels.</p>
        <p>Special options available options on wagon models were either a roller blind or extending boot cover with
          patrician net for the rear boot area, roller sun visors for rear and side windows.</p>
        <p>A "latent heat accumulator" was available as an option up until September 1999. The accumulator stores
          engine heat by converting a salt from solid to liquid form (phase transition). The insulated tank can
          store heat for several days. The next time the vehicle is started, this heat is automatically used to reduce
          exhaust emissions (by heating the engine up to operating temperature quicker), for cabin heating and window
          defrosting.</p>
        <p>Separate to the latent heat accumulator is the Residual Heat function (activated by a button labelled
          "REST"), which allows the demister and cabin heater to use the heat of an engine that has recently been
          turned off (using an electric pump to push hot coolant through the heater core)</p>

        <h2>Petrol engines</h2>

        <p>At launch, the petrol engines consisted of the BMW M52 straight-6 engines and the BMW M62 V8 engines. In late
          1998, the "technical update" (TÜ) versions of these engines were introduced, introducing double VANOS to the
          M52
          and single VANOS to the M62, primarily to increase torque at low rpm.</p>
        <p>For the facelift of the model range in the year 2000, the M52 was replaced by the BMW M54 straight-6 engine
          and the version used in the 530i model topped the Ward's 10 Best Engines list in 2002 and 2003. The
          post-facelift V8 models (535i and 540i) continued to use the M62TÜ engine.</p>
        <h2>Diesel engines</h2>
        <p>The initial diesel models used the BMW M51 turbocharged straight-6 engine carried over from its predecessor.
          In
          1998, its successor the BMW M57 was introduced in the 530d model, however the BMW M51 engine continued to be
          used
          for two more years in the 525td and 525tds models.</p>
        <p>In 1999, the M47 four-cylinder turbo-diesel was introduced in the 520d model, which is the only E39 model to
          use
          a four-cylinder engine.</p>
        <h2>M5 model</h2>
        <p>The M5 model of the E39 was introduced in 1998 at the Geneva Motor Show and was produced from 1998 to 2003.
          It
          was powered by the S62 V8 engine producing 394 horsepower. All E39 M5 cars that were made were sold in the
          saloon
          body style with a 6-speed manual transmission. A single M5 Touring model was made, but was never sold or put
          into
          production.</p>
        <h2>Alpina E39 models</h2>
        <p>The Alpina B10 3.2, 3.3, V8 and V8S petrol-engined models were built in saloons and wagon body styles based
          on
          the E39 from January 1997 to May 2004.</p>
        <p>The Alpina B10 3.2 was based on an E39 528i saloon produced by Alpina from August 1997 to December 1998. It
          was
          first shown to the public at the IAA Motor show in 1997. The engine is a 6 cylinder petrol producing 260 bhp
          and
          330 nm of torque to the rear driving wheels. 0–60 miles per hour in 6.7 seconds and a top speed of 160 miles
          per
          hour. The B10 3.2 was only available to buy in a 5 speed manual ZF gearbox and only 260 were ever made.</p>
        <p>The Alpina B10 V8 pre-facelift was based on an E39 540i saloon produced by Alpina from January 1997 to
          October
          1998. The engine is an 8 cylinder petrol producing 340 bhp and 470 nm of torque to the rear driving wheels.
          0–60
          miles per hour in 5.9 seconds and a top speed of 180 miles per hour. The steering wheel was hand stitched by a
          professional working for Alpina. The B10 V8 pre-facelift was available to buy in a 5 speed manual ZF gearbox
          or
          an
          automatic gearbox and with it being one of Alpina's most successful cars, roughly 1300 were sold worldwide
          also
          including the post-facelift models, the Touring models and the B10 V8 S models.</p>
        <p>The Alpina B10 V8 post-facelift was based on an E39 540i saloon produced by Alpina from September 2000 to
          February 2002. The engine is an 8 cylinder petrol producing 347 bhp and 480 nm of torque to the rear driving
          wheels. 0–60 miles per hour in 5.6 seconds and a top speed of 173 miles per hour. The B10 V8 post-facelift was
          available to buy in a 5 speed manual ZF gearbox or an automatic gearbox.</p>
        <p>The Alpina B10 V8 Touring was based on an E39 540i Touring produced by Alpina from October 1998 to July 2000.
          The
          engine is an 8 cylinder petrol producing 347 bhp and 480 nm of torque to the rear driving wheels. 0–60 miles
          per
          hour in 6.2 seconds and a top speed of 173 miles per hour. The B10 V8 Touring was available to buy in a 5
          speed
          manual ZF gearbox or an automatic gearbox.</p>
        <p>The Alpina B10 V8 S was based on an E39 540i saloon produced by Alpina from January 2002 to May 2004. The
          engine
          is an 8 cylinder petrol producing 375 bhp and 510 nm of torque to the rear driving wheels. 0–60 miles per hour
          in
          5.4 seconds and a top speed of 176 miles per hour. The B10 V8 S was available to buy in a 5 speed automatic.
        </p>
        <p>The Alpina D10 Biturbo was the first diesel car produced by Alpina and was based on an E39 530d. The D10 was
          in
          production from April 2000 to October 2003. It was first shown to the public in 1999 at the Geneva Motor show

          engine was a 6 cylinder diesel producing 500 nm of torque to the rear driving wheels. 0–60 miles per hour in
          7.2
          seconds and a top speed of 157 miles per hour. The D10 Biturbo was available to buy in a Getrag 6 speed manual
          or
          a ZF 5 speed automatic and only 94 were ever made.</p>
        <p>The Alpina D10 was the first diesel model produced by Alpina and was introduced in February 2000. The engine,
          a
          3.0 litre twin-turbocharged unit rated at 180 kW (241 hp) and 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft) of torque, was based on the
