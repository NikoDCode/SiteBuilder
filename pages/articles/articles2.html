        <h1>BMW 5 Series (E28)</h1>

        <h2>Body and interior</h2>
        <p>The E28 has a self-supporting body that is welded to the body platform. The passenger cell is a safety
          passenger
          cell with deformation elements both in the front and rear of the vehicle. Unlike its E12 predecessor and E34
          successor, the E28 has a rear-hinged bonnet. The boot has a volume of 460 L (122 US gal). Most models have a
          fuel
          tank capacity of 70 L (18 US gal), with some models having a smaller tank of 63 litres (17 US gal). The kerb
          weight is 1,140–1,410 kg (2,513–3,109 lb).</p>
        <p>Cruise control, an on-board computer (to display trip information), and a "check control" panel (to alert the
          driver about fluid levels and lighting faults) were introduced to the 5 Series on the E28. The glazing is made
          of
          single-pane safety glass, the windscreen has laminated glass. As part of developing the air-conditioning
          system
          for the E28, several of the BMW engineers in charge of this program drove a previous generation E12 5 Series
          during the middle of summer in Texas. The E12 528i was painted black with a black interior, and driven 500 mi
          (805
          km) in one day.</p>
        <p>The styling was developed under BMW's chief designer Claus Luthe, with development of the E28 beginning in
          1975. At the time that BMW was designing the E28, the company had only one computer, which was used for
          payroll
          management and spare parts logistics. Wolfgang Matschinsky and his team borrowed that computer to perform the
          calculations necessary to develop the new drivetrain and chassis. This was due to the fact that the addition
          of
          an
          ABS system necessitated a redesign from the previous model due to excessive vibrations under heavy braking.
        </p>
        <h2>Engines</h2>
        <p>The E28 was the first 5 Series produced with diesel engines (the 524d and 524td models) and with a petrol
          engined
          model specifically aimed at increased fuel economy (525e/528e model).</p>
        <p>The four models available at the launch of the E28 were the 518, 520i, 525i and 528i,[9] with the 518 using a
          straight-four petrol engine and the other three models using a straight-six petrol engine. Over the course of
          the
          E28 model, the following models were added: the 524d and 524td using diesel engines, the 518i (a fuel-injected
          version of the 518), the 525e/528e as fuel-economy models, and the upper-specification 533i, 535i, M535i, and
          M5
          models.</p>
        <p>A liquid petroleum gas (LPG) option was introduced for some petrol engines in 1984.</p>
        <h2>Petrol Models</h2>
        <p>518: Sold only in some European markets where it suited local tax categories, the 518 was the lowest
          specification model which used a four-cylinder engine with a carburetor. Factory performance figures for the
          manual transmission cars are a top speed of 164 km/h (102 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 14.0 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>518i: The base model in Japan and some European countries, the 518i used a fuel-injected four-cylinder
          engine.
          Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top speed of 175 km/h (109 mph) and 0–100
          km/h
          acceleration in 12.6 seconds. This version was not sold in Germany until the 1984 facelift, when it replaced
          the carburetted 518.</p>
        <p>520i: A mid-range model with the smallest of the available six-cylinder engines. Factory performance figures
          for
          the manual transmission cars are a top speed of 190 km/h (118 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 11.4
          seconds.
        </p>
        <p>525e / 528e: The 525e (called 528e in North America and Japan) uses a longer stroke 2.7-litre version of the
          6-cylinder M20 petrol engine, is optimised for fuel economy and torque at low engine speed rather than the
          traditional high revving characteristics of BMW straight-six engines. The "e" stands for the Greek letter eta,
          for economy. According to BMW, the 525e is more fuel efficient than the 520i, which has the same rated power
          of
          92
          kW. Since many markets tax cars based on engine displacement, the eta's larger engine meant that it was not
          suitable everywhere. The model was expressly developed with the American market in mind. BMW's corporate
          average
          fuel economy was at risk of not meeting requirements by 1984, primarily due to higher sales of their bigger,
          more
          expensive cars in the early 1980s. In Austria, the 525e was detuned to 88 kW (118 hp).</p>
        <p>Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars without a catalytic converter are a top speed of
          190
          km/h (118 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 10.7 seconds. With a catalytic converter, the figures are a top
          speed of 188 km/h (117 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 11.3 seconds</p>
        <p>525i: This mid-range model is powered by a 2.5-litre 6-cylinder engine. The 525i was only sold in Europe.
          Factory
          performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph) and 0–100 km/h
          acceleration in 9.8 seconds.[3]</p>
        <p>528i: Initially the highest specification available, the 6-cylinder 528i became a mid-range model following
          the
          release of the 533i and 535i models. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top
          speed
          of 215 km/h (134 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 8.4 seconds.</p>
        <p>533i: Only sold in Japan and North America, the 6-cylinder 533i was the highest specification model
          during its production years of 1983–1984. It was replaced by the 535i.</p>
        <p>535i/is: Released in 1984, the 535i replaced the 533i and uses the same 6-cylinder drivetrain as the M535i.
          In
          the US there was also a 535is model, which included sport seats and spoilers at the front and rear. Factory
          performance figures for the manual transmission cars without a catalytic converter are a top speed of 225 km/h
          (140 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.2 seconds. With a catalytic converter, the figures are a top speed
          of
          212 km/h (132 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.9 seconds</p>
        <p>M535i: The top of the regular production model range, the M535i uses the drivetrain from the 535i plus
          M-Technic
          suspension, and wheels and body panels not found on any other E28. The M535i was assembled on the standard E28
          assembly lines in Dingolfing and Rosslyn. Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars without
          a
          catalytic converter are a top speed of 230 km/h (143 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.2 seconds. With a
          catalytic converter, the figures are a top speed of 217 km/h (135 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.9
          seconds</p>
        <h2>Dieles Models</h2>
        <p>524d: At the 1986 Geneva Motor Show, four years after the introduction of the more powerful 524td model, the
          naturally-aspirated 524d model was introduced.: 188, 190  It was only sold in some markets.: 191 </p>
        <p>524td: This turbodiesel model was the first diesel car produced by BMW. It entered production in late 1982,
          when
          100 pre-series cars were built.[23] Factory performance figures for the manual transmission cars are a top
          speed
          of 180 km/h (112 mph) and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 12.9 seconds.</p>
        <h2>M5 models</h2>
        <p>The E28 was the first M5 model produced, and is powered by the M88/3 and S38 straight-six engines.</p>
